# ROI-NeRFs: Hi-Fi Visualization of Objects of Interest within a Scene by NeRFs Composition

This repository is a fork of [Nerfstudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio), extended with a Region-of-Interest (ROI) decomposition-composition paradigm for high-fidelity neural rendering.

## Method Overview

ROI-NeRFs addresses the uniform level-of-detail limitation in standard NeRF pipelines by introducing the decomposition–recomposition concept on NeRFs to achieve efficient and detailed 3D reconstruction of complex scenes. 
The proposed ROI-NeRFs framework separates the scene into global and local NeRFs, each optimized for different levels of detail. 
A semi-automatic Camera Selection technique ensures Object-Focused training, while a Ray-Level Compositional Rendering strategy merges components seamlessly. 
The approach significantly enhances specific objects fidelity with minimal computational overhead.
The method builds primarily on the [Nerfacto](https://docs.nerf.studio/nerfology/methods/nerfacto.html) method of Nerfstudio.
